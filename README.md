# EFCoreInheritance

Description: This is a Template .NET 8 WebAPI Project with Minimal APIs and Swagger, multiple model inheritance in EFCore with local SQlite Tables. 
Each project has a different Table structure:
* TPT : Table per Type
* TPH : Table per Hierarchy
* TPC : Table per Concrete Type

Note: Same models were used in each of the projects for optimal table structure comparison

***Open Visual Studio, download SQLite Extension. Open App.db on each project and compare the structure of the Tables***

*Base abstract classes are Article and Person.*
